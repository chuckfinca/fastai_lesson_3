### Overview
This project is part of Fast.ai Lesson 3, involving setting up a machine learning environment, data preparation, model building, training, and optimization.

### Motivation
To learn and apply fundamental machine learning concepts through a hands-on approach.

### Technologies Used
Python, Fast.ai, Jupyter Notebook, Matplotlib, Pkg_vers, various Python libraries.

### Approach
Setup the environment, prepare data, build and train the model, perform hyperparameter tuning, and attempt model improvement.

### Challenges and Learnings
Ensuring correct data preparation, effective hyperparameter tuning, and inconsistent results with model improvement techniques.

### Key Takeaways
Importance of data preparation, configuring and training models, practical experience with hyperparameter tuning, and recognizing model improvement challenges.

### Acknowledgments
Thanks to Fast.ai and the developers of the various Python libraries used.

## Setup and Run Instructions

This will guide you through the process of setting up a Mamba environment and running the provided Python code to see it in action. It uses the last known working versions of Python and packages used.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) installed on your system. Mamba is a fast, cross-platform package manager.

### Steps

1. **Create a Mamba Environment**
   
   Open your terminal and execute the following commands:

   ```bash
   mamba create -n myenv python=3.9.19 -y
   mamba activate myenv

2. **Install Necessary Packages**

    ```bash
    # Install each with mamba and fall back to pip if necessary
    for pkg in PIL, csv, fastai=2.7.14, itertools, matplotlib=3.8.0, pandas=2.2.1, pkg_vers=0.0.6, readme_ation=0.1.11, seaborn=0.12.2; do mamba install $pkg -y || pip install $pkg; done

3. **Run the Script**

    Ensure you are in your project directory and run the file you added the readme-ation code to and run:

    ```bash
    python [FILE_NAME]

    Or click 'run' in your IDE of choice.
